This repository has Stata do file as well as R markdown file to reproduce analysis and results for a published paper: Does age-adjusted measurement of contraceptive use better explain the relationship between fertility and contraception? (Demographic Research 2018 Dec 39;45:1227-1240). The abstract, the complete paper, and full publication information is available here: https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol39/45/39-45.pdf.

There are three sections in each document (R markdown or Stata do file) for: accessing public data (in this case, DHS API data); preparing the analysis data file; and conducting analysis. Analysis section contains code for reproducing results presented in the paper only. The paper was prepared using Stata.

Output of the R markdown file is available here (coming soon).
